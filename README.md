# Welcome to y/cs Code Camp Day 2!

Today, we will be learning about React and JSX! We will start by exploring React at a higher level, and then creating our first React project with Vite.

After creating our boilerplate project, we will use what we learned in day 1 to create a user-friendly display for a Pokémon team with PokéAPI.

Lastly, we will learn about custom components with props and useState to level up our code and allow users to add new, random pokemon to their team and name them!

To catch up to where we are at during any stage of the process, use the folders labeled 01-05 from our starting point to finished project.
